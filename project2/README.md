1. Rename the input file to 'input.csv'
2. Place the input file in the same folder with train.py, test.py and MealNoMealData folder
3. Run train.py first which will create the model.pkl file
4. Run test.py

### Tasks:
* Extract features from Meal and No Meal data
* Make sure that the features are discriminatory
* Train a separate machine to recognize Meal or No Meal data
* Use k fold cross validation on the training data to evaluate your recognition system
* Write a function that takes one test sample as input and outputs 1 if it predicts the test sample as meal or 0 if it predicts test sample as No meal.
